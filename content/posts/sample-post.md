## Quick answer
Most circulated Bicentennial quarters are worth face value, but higher-grade examples, special issues, and certain errors can be worth more.

## How to identify the valuable ones
- Check the mint mark (D, no mint mark, or S)
- Look for strong strike details
- Compare against known error types

## Common error types to watch
- Double die (doubling in lettering/details)
- Off-center strike
- Clipped planchet
